# portfolio_site
Contains all files and code supporting my personal website.

### Last updated: April 2, 2025

This website is meant to be a first impression of the work I can put out for potential employers, and supply information about my prior works, ideally with links to relevant sources, when available.
It will be a continuous work that I update throughout my career, preferably *at least __once per two months__*.

## Current Contents:

- Main homepage with Introductory Info about me and some social links.

## Next Planned Features:

1. Barebones homepage containing:
   - <s>Name</s>
   - <s>City, State, USA</s>
   - <s>Current Title *or* Software Engineering Degree</s>
   - <s>Contact Email</s>
   - <s>LinkedIn profile</s>
   - <s>Github profile</s>
   - Resume PDF link
2. *Projects* <s>page</s> scrollable carousel with links to displayed projects
3. *Research* page with links or DOIs for papers
4. CSS to make the base pages look *pretty*
5. **TBD...**
