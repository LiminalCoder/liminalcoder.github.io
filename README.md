# liminalcoder.github.io
Contains all files and code supporting my portfolio website.

### Last updated: April 2, 2025

This website is meant to be a first impression of the work I can put out for potential employers, and supply information about my prior works, ideally with links to relevant sources, when available.
It will be a continuous work that I update throughout my career, preferably *at least __once per two months__*.

## Current Contents:

1. Barebones homepage containing:
   - Name
   - City, State, USA
   - Current Title *or* Software Engineering Degree
   - Contact Email
   - LinkedIn profile
   - Github profile
   - Resume PDF link
2. *Projects and Research* carousel with links to displayed projects

## Next Planned Features:

4. Pictures to represent my projects with a visual before following the links
5. CSS to make the base pages look *pretty*
6. **TBD...**
